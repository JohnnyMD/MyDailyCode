    The problem:
        There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

        For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
        1, 1, 1, 1
        2, 1, 1
        1, 2, 1
        1, 1, 2
        2, 2
        What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? 
        For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.

    This problem was recently asked by Google.

      Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
      For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
      Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
